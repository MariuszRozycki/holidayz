# Holidaze - Accommodation Booking Application

## **Overview**

Holidaze is a modern front-end application for an accommodation booking platform. The project was developed as part of **Project Exam 2** for Noroff Front-end Development, aiming to showcase both visual and technical development skills. The application consists of two main sections:

- **Customer-facing website**: Users can browse, search, and book venues for their holidays.
- **Admin-facing dashboard**: Venue managers can register, manage venues, and oversee bookings.

This project integrates with the existing Holidaze API for all backend functionality, focusing solely on the development of the front end.
